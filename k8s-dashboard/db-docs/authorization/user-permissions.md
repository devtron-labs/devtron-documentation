##### Role-based Access Levels

Devtron supports the following levels of access:

2. **View and Edit**: User with `View and Edit` access can view as well as edit the helm charts whose access is granted to that user.
3. **Admin**: User with `Admin` access can create, edit, delete, and view permitted Helm apps in the permitted projects.

| User Roles       | View        | Deploy         | Edit        | Delete        |
| :---:            |  :---:      |    :---:       |   :---:     |   :---:       |
| View Only        | Yes         | No             | No          | No            |

## Edit User Permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
Direct user permissions cannot be edited if you're using [LDAP](./sso-login-services/ldap.md)/[Microsoft](./sso-login-services/microsoft.md) for SSO and 'auto-assign permission' is enabled. Permissions can only be [managed via permission groups](./permission-groups.md#edit-permissions-groups) in such a scenario.
{% endhint %}

You can edit the user permissions by clicking the edit icon.

Edit the user permissions.

After you have done editing the user permissions, click `Save`.

If you want to delete the user/users with particular permissions, click `Delete`.
