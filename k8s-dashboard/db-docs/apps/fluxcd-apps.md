## Preface

Flux CD doesn't have any official dashboard; however, Devtron supports the listing of your [Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) apps in one dashboard.

With Devtron, you get an entire Flux CD app listing in one place. This listing includes:
* Flux CD apps present in the cluster where Devtron is installed
* Flux CD apps present in other clusters you added to Devtron
