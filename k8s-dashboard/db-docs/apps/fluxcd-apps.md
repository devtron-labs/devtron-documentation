Flux CD doesn't have any official dashboard; however, Devtron supports the listing of your [Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) apps in one dashboard.

## Advantages

Devtron also bridges the gap for Flux CD users by providing additional features as follows:

* **Resource Scanning**: You can scan for vulnerabilities using Devtron's [resource scanning](../../user-guide/security-features.md#from-app-details) feature. [![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg)](https://devtron.ai/pricing)

* **Single-pane View**: All Flux CD apps will show details such as their app status, environment, cluster, and namespace together in one dashboard. 

* **Feature-rich Options**: Clicking an Flux CD app will give you access to its logs, terminal, events, manifest, available resource kinds, pod restart log, and many more.
