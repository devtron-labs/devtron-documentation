# View ArgoCD App Listing

## Preface

In Argo CD, a user manages one dashboard for one ArgoCD instance. Therefore, with multiple ArgoCD instances, the process becomes cumbersome for the user to manage several dashboards.

With Devtron, you get an entire Argo CD app listing in one place. This listing includes:
* Argo CD apps present in the cluster where Devtron is installed
* Argo CD apps present in other clusters you added to Devtron
