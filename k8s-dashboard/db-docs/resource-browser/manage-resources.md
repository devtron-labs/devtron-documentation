# Discover and Manage Resources 

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
Users need to have [access to the cluster](../../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions) to discover resources.
{% endhint %}

## Search a Resource

You can use the searchbox to browse the resources.

### Filter Resources [![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg)](https://devtron.ai/pricing)

Moreover, you can use filters that allow you to quickly filter your workload as per labels, field selectors, or [CEL expression](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/) as shown below.

### Resource Kinds

Resource kinds displayed upfront for you to manage:

* Nodes
* Events
* Namespaces

Further resources in the cluster are grouped under the following categories:

* Namespace
* Workloads
* Config & Storage
* Networking
* RBAC
* Administration
* Other Resources
* Custom Resource

## Edit a Manifest 

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
User needs to be an [admin of the Kubernetes resource](../../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions) to edit its manifest.
{% endhint %}

You can edit the [manifest](../../../reference/glossary.md#manifest) of a Kubernetes object. This can be for fixing errors, scaling resources, or changing configuration.

---

## View Events

You can monitor activities like creation, deletion, updation, scaling, or errors in the resources involved. Refer [Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/event-v1/) to learn more.

## Delete a Resource

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
User needs to be an [admin of the Kubernetes resource](../../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions) to delete it.
{% endhint %}

You can delete an unwanted resource if it is orphaned and no longer required by your applications.

## Create a Resource

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
User needs to be an [admin of the Kubernetes resources](../../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions) to create resources.
{% endhint %}

You can create one or more [Kubernetes objects](../../../reference/glossary.md#objects) in your cluster using YAML. In case you wish to create multiple objects, separate each resource definition by three dashes (---).

Once you select a cluster in Resource Browser, click **+ Create Resource**, and add the resource definition.  

In the below example, we have created a simple pod named `nginx`:

Here's one more example that shows the required fields and object specifications for a Kubernetes Deployment:

{% code title="Spec File" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels: 
     app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
       app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
       - name: nginx
         image: nginx:1.14.2
         ports:
         - containerPort: 80
```
{% endcode %}
