# Resource Browser

## Introduction

The Devtron Resource Browser provides you a central interface to view and manage all your [Kubernetes objects](../../../reference/glossary.md#objects) across clusters.  It helps you perform key actions like viewing logs, editing live manifests, and even creating/deleting resources directly from the user interface. This is especially useful for troubleshooting purposes as it supports multi-cluster too.

First, the Resource Browser shows you a list of clusters added to your Devtron setup. By default, it displays a cluster named '*default_cluster*' after the [initial setup](../setup/install/README.md) is successful.

You can easily connect more clusters by clicking the **Add Cluster** button located at the top of the browser. This will take you to the [Cluster & Environments](../../global-configurations/cluster-and-environments.md) configuration within [Global Configurations](../../global-configurations/README.md).

You may click a cluster to view and manage all its resources as shown below.
