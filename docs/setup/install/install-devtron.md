## Devtron Admin Credentials

When you install Devtron for the first time, it creates a default admin user and password (with unrestricted access to Devtron). You can use that credentials to log in as an administrator. 

**Username**: `admin` <br />
**Password**: Run the following command to get the admin password:

```bash
kubectl -n devtroncd get secret devtron-secret \
-o jsonpath='{.data.ADMIN_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d
```

### Next Recommended Action

When you install Devtron for the first time, it creates a default admin user and password (with unrestricted access to Devtron). You can use it to log in as an administrator.

After the initial login, we recommend you set up any [Single Sign-On (SSO)](../../user-guide/global-configurations/sso-login.md) service like Google, GitHub, etc., and then add other users (including yourself). Subsequently, all the users can use the same SSO (e.g., GitHub) to log in to the Dashboard.
