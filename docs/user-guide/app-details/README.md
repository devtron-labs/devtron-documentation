# App Details

## Introduction

The **App Details** page acts as a comprehensive dashboard that provides a bird's-eye view of your application (e.g., Devtron, Helm, ArgoCD, FluxCD). From the **App Details** page, you can: 

* View your application status 

* Scan for vulnerabilities 

* Monitor application metrics (e.g., CPU usage and memory usage)

* Manage the most widely used Kubernetes resources

* Deploy your application

* Modify environment configurations 

* Rollback deployments and much more

Consider the **App Details** page as the following two sections:

* [Application summary](application-summary.md) - Where you can view your application and deployment statuses, application metrics, swap traffic, scale workloads, deploy, and do more. 

* [Manage Kubernetes resources](app-resource-management.md) - Where you can manage the logs, manifest, and events of your Kubernetes resources and scan for vulnerabilities.
