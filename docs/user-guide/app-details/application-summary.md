# Application Summary

## Introduction

Devtron helps you to view your application summary in the form of [cards](#cards-overview) and [Application Metrics](#application-metrics). It also helps you perform [quick actions](#action-icons) and [manage the most widely used Kubernetes resources](app-resource-management.md) directly from the **App Details** page.

### Who can perform this action?

Anyone with a `View Only` permission can view this page, but only those at the level of `Admin` (with specific app permissions) or above can take actions on this page. Refer to [User Permissions](../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md) for more information. 

{% endhint %}

Follow the below steps to access the **App Details** page: 

1. Navigate to **Applications** and choose your preferred application. 

2. Choose **App Details** and select the environment for which you'd like to see the application summary in the **Env** drop-down box. 

The icon next to the **Env** drop-down box denotes the application deployment method. It can be any of the following: 

* Deployed using Helm

* Deployed using ArgoCD

* Deployed using FluxCD

![Figure 2: Deployment Method and Manifest Status](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/dep-method-manifest-status.jpg)

Manifest status (whether they are in sync or not) is denoted by [this](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/manifest-status-icon.jpg) icon. When you click on this icon, the **Live and desired manifest comparison** page is displayed (read-only) allowing you to compare the manifests and view config drifts (if there are any).

## Cards Overview

Devtron provides you a quick summary of your application via cards. Refer to the following table to know more about cards:

| **Card Name** |**Description**|
|:------------- |:--------------| 
| **Application Status** | Tells you the application status (e.g., `Healthy` or `Degraded`). The available application statuses in Devtron are: <br><ul><li>Degraded</li><li>Healthy</li><li>Hibernating</li><li>Missing</li><li>Not Deployed</li><li>Progressing</li></ul> When you click **Details**, all the details about the resource kinds, their statuses, and the message (if any) are displayed. | 
| **Blackout Window** / **Maintenance Window** ![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg)| Tells you whether the application deployment is blocked or allowed for the chosen environment. This card also displays the upcoming blackout/maintenance window and the remaining time for the blackout/maintenance window to complete. Refer to [Deployment Window](../global-configurations/deployment-window.md) for more information. |

## Action Icons

You can perform a variety of actions right from the **App Details** page using the following action icons:

### URLs

When you click the **URLs** icon, the **URLs** page is displayed with the [Ingress Host URL](../../reference/glossary.md#ingress-host-url) and the [Load Balancer URL](../../reference/glossary.md#load-balancer-url) (if available).

![Figure 3a: URLs icon](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/urls-apppage.jpg)

![Figure 3b: URLs Page](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/debugging-deployment-and-monitoring/ingress-host-url1.jpg)

You can directly copy the URLs (Ingress and Load Balancer) from the **URLs** page instead of searching in the manifest. 

The Ingress Host URL will point to the load balancer of your application, and you can also view the service name with the load balancer details.

### Hibernate

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

* This functionality is available as **Hibernate/Unhibernate** icons in Devtron apps and as a **Scale Workloads** icon in Helm apps.

* When there is an ongoing blackout or maintenance window for the application, then the option to hibernate or unhibernate that app (**Scale Workloads**, in the case of a Helm app) will be restricted.

{% endhint %}

The **Hibernate** icon (**Scale Workloads**, in the case of a Helm app) allows you to hibernate (to rest) your application when not in use by scaling down the pods to nearly zero in that selected environment (e.g., `QA`). The application will automatically unhibernate when you make a new deployment. 

However, you can manually unhibernate the application by clicking the **Unhibernate** icon. 

![Figure 4: Hibernate Your Application](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/hibernate.jpg)

### Restart Workloads 

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

* The **Restart Workloads** icon is available only for Devtron custom applications.

* When there is an ongoing blackout or maintenance window for the application, then the **Restart Workloads** icon will be restricted.

{% endhint %}

When you are facing issues with your application (e.g., crashing of pods) or prefer to use a new configuration, you restart the workloads. When you click the **Restart Workloads** icon, the **Restart Workloads** page is displayed.

![Figure 5: Restart Workloads](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/restart-workloads.jpg)

When you select a workload and click **Restart Workloads**, all the pods for the selected workloads are restarted using the configured deployment strategy (e.g., `Rolling`).

### Rollback

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

* The **Rollback** icon is available only for Devtron custom applications.

* You will not be able to rollback your deployment during blackout window and outside maintenance window of the application.

{% endhint %}

You can perform a rollback of your deployment directly from the **App Details** page. When you click the **Rollback** icon, the following page is displayed. 

![Figure 6: Rollback Your Deployment](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/rollback.jpg)

* Select an image from the available list of previously deployed images in that specific environment. 

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

When there is an active policy in place for an environment, and there are no approved images, then no images will be displayed in the **Rollback** page.

{% endhint %}

* Select one of the following deployment configurations in the **Deploy** drop-down box:

    * Last Saved Config

    * Last Deployed Config

    * Config Deployed with Selected Image

* Review configuration differences (if any) by selecting the **Review** option. If there is any config difference, it will be highlighted in this section.

* Choose a deployment strategy in the **Rolling (Default)** drop-down box. 

* Click **Deploy**.

### Deploy

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

* The **Deploy** button is available only for Devtron custom applications. 

* When there is an ongoing blackout or maintenance window for the application, the **Deploy** button will be changed to **Deployment is Blocked** and you will not be able to deploy during this time period.

{% endhint %}

Devtron helps you in deploying images directly from the **App Details** page. When you click the **Deploy** button, the following page is displayed. 

![Figure 7: Deploy Your Application](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/creating-application/app-details/deploy.jpg)

Follow the below steps to deploy an image:

* Select an image from the available list of previously deployed images in that specific environment. 

* Select one of the following deployment configurations in the **Deploy** drop-down box:

    * Last Saved Config

    * Last Deployed Config

    * Config Deployed with Selected Image

* Review configuration difference (if any) by selecting the **Review** option. If there is any config difference, it will be highlighted in this section.

* Choose a deployment strategy in the **Rolling (Default)** drop-down box. 

* Click **Deploy**.

### Environment Configurations

{% hint style="info" %}

### Note

The **Environment Configuration** icon is available only for Devtron custom applications. 

{% endhint %}
