# Command bar
## Why command bar?
The command bar is designed to enable you to navigate across the devtron dashboard without having to click around the screen.

Top-level categories (eg. app, chart, security, global-config) are auto-filled depending upon your location on the Devtron dashboard.

> You can clear the top-level category to navigate within other category locations.
