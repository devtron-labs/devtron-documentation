# Cost Visibility

## Introduction <a href="https://devtron.ai/pricing"><img src="https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg" className="enterprise-badge-img" /></a>

Cost Visibility in Devtron provides a unified view of your Kubernetes infrastructure costs within the Devtron dashboard. It eliminates the need to switch between cloud provider billing consoles by bringing all cost insights into a single interface.

You can view and analyze costs across multiple scopes such as [Clusters](../../reference/glossary.md#cluster), [Projects](../global-configurations/projects.md), [Environments](../../reference/glossary.md#environment), [Applications](../../reference/glossary.md#devtron-apps), and Infrastructure Resources. Devtron automatically tracks the spend on CPU, Memory, Storage, and GPU, giving you a clear picture of how different resources contribute to your overall cost and where most of your spend is concentrated.

The dashboard highlights recommended costs and potential savings, helping you identify over-provisioned resources and opportunities for optimization. 

You can choose your preferred currency to view all cost data consistently across different time periods, such as daily, monthly, quarterly, or custom ranges. This helps you move seamlessly from a high-level overview to a granular analysis of costs within a specific category.
