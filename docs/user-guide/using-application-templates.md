# Creating Application From Template

Application templates provide a predefined configuration for creating new applications. You can create an application from an application template to avoid manual configurations(such as build configurations, base configurations, CI/CD workflows, and environment details.)

Refer [Application Templates](./global-configurations/application-template.md) to learn more.

You can create an application using an application template by following the below steps:

1. On the Devtron dashboard, select **Applications**.

2. On the upper-right corner of the screen, click **Create**.

3. Select **Custom app** from the drop-down list; a **Create Devtron Application** modal window will appear.

4. Select **From template** from the left-side of the modal window; a list of all application templates will appear.

5. Select the application template from which you want to create the application; you can also search for the preferred application template from the search bar.

6. After selecting the application template, you need to provide the following details

    | Field                     | Required/Optional | Description                                  |
    | :------------------------ | :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
    | **Project** | Required          | Provide a name for the Application Template  |
    | **Template ID**           | Required          | Provide an ID for the Application Template   |
    | **Description**           | Optional          | Provide a short for the Application Template |
