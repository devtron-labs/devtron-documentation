# Resource Recommender

## Introduction [![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/elements/EnterpriseTag.svg)](https://devtron.ai/pricing)

**Resource Recommender** is a Devtron feature that analyzes the history of resource usage (such as CPU and memory) for Kubernetes workloads in a specific cluster and generates data-backed recommendations for optimal resource allocation. 

These recommendations are generated by a background job that runs daily at a specific time by default, using resource usage metrics collected from Prometheus. Job frequency can be customized by modifying the configuration in the ConfigMap. Refer to [Modify Resource Recommender Job Schedule](#modify-resource-recommender-job-schedule) to learn more.

It helps users eliminate manual guesswork, reduce over-provisioning, and prevent performance issues caused by under-provisioned workloads.

### Prerequisites

* Prometheus endpoint must be configured. Refer to the [Cluster and Environments](../global-configurations/cluster-and-environments.md#configure-prometheus-enable-application-metrics)

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?

To view recommendations, users need to have [view permissions for the specific cluster](../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions).

To apply recommendations, users need to have [admin permissions for the specific cluster](../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#kubernetes-resources-permissions).

{% endhint %}

## Inspect Recommendations

To inspect the resource recommendations, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to **Resource Browser**.

      ![Figure 1: Navigating to Resource Browser](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-resourse-browser.jpg)

2. Select the specific cluster for which you want to inspect the resource recommendations.

      ![Figure 2: Selecting Cluster](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-select-cluster.jpg)

3. Select the **Resource Recommender** tab to inspect the recommendations. 

      ![Figure 3: Selecting Resource Recommender](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-click-rr-button.jpg)
      1. Each row displays workloads in that cluster, along with recommendations for CPU and memory.

           ![Figure 4: Displaying Workloads along with Recommendations](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-each-workload.jpg) 

      2. Recommendations are shown as percentage changes by default. You can use the **Show absolute values** checkbox to see current v/s recommended values in actual units (e.g., 128Mi → 4900Ki).

           ![Figure 5: Toggling 'Show Absolute Values'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-absolute-values.jpg)

 {% hint style="info"%}
 ### No Recommendations
 * In case you have just configured the Prometheus endpoint, you might face the **No recommendations yet** screen after selecting **Resource Recommender**. 
 
 * Click **Check for Recommendations** to initiate the scan, and recommendations will be available in a few minutes.
 {%endhint%}

4. You can inspect the resource recommendations for each workload within the cluster.
     1. If you wish, you can filter the workloads based on their `Kind` and `Namespace`.

           ![Figure 6a: Filtering via 'Kind'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-kind.jpg)

           ![Figure 6b: Filtering via 'Namespace'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-namespace.jpg)

     2. You can also search for a specific workload via the search bar based on `WORKLOAD`, `NAMESPACE`, `KIND`, `API VERSION`, and `CONTAINER NAME`. 

           ![Figure 7: Filtering via Search Bar](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-search.jpg)

5. For each workload, recommendations can be of the following types:

 ### Types of Recommendation

 | Type  | Visual Indicator  |Description                              |
 |:---   |:---               |:---|
 |`↑`   | Red upward arrow   |Indicates that the current resource allocation is **below the recommended threshold**, and more resources should be provisioned to ensure successful builds. |
 |`↓`   | Green downward arrow |Indicates that the current resource allocation is **above the recommended requirement**, and resources can be safely reduced to optimize cost and efficiency. |
 |`0% -`| Gray dash (-)      |Indicates that the current allocation **matches the recommended value**, and no changes are needed.|
 |`No Recommendation`|`No Recommendation`| No recommendation available |

 ### Supported Resources

 | Type           |Description                              |
 |:---            |:---                                     |
 |`CPU REQUESTS`  |**CPU** guaranteed to the workload|
 |`CPU LIMITS`    |Maximum **CPU** allocatable to the workload, if available|
 |`MEM REQUESTS`  |**Memory (RAM)** guaranteed to the workload|
 |`MEM LIMITS`    |Maximum **Memory (RAM)** allocatable to the workload, if available|

6. Hover the cursor over the specific resource of the particular workload to view the recommendation.
