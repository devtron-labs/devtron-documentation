# Resource Recommender 

## Introduction

**Resource Recommender** is a Devtron feature that analyzes the historical resource usage (such as CPU and memory) of Kubernetes workloads in a specific cluster and generates data-backed recommendations for optimal resource allocation. 


These recommendations are generated by a background job that runs daily at a particular time by default, using resource usage metrics collected from Prometheus. Job frequency can be customized by modifying the configuration in the ConfigMap. Refer 

It helps users eliminate manual guesswork, reduce over-provisioning, and prevent performance issues caused by under-provisioned workloads.

### Prerequisites

* Prometheus endpoint must be configured. Refer to the [Cluster and Environments](./global-configurations/cluster-and-environments.md#configure-prometheus-enable-application-metrics)

## Inspect Recommendations

To inspect the resource recommendations, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to **Resource Browser**.

      ![Figure 1: Navigating to Resource Browser](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-resourse-browser.jpg)

2. Select the specific cluster for which you want to inspect the resource recommendations.

      ![Figure 2: Selecting Cluster](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-select-cluster.jpg)

3. Select the **Resource Recommender** tab to inspect the recommendations. 

      ![Figure 3: Selecting Resource Recommender](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-click-rr-button.jpg)
      1. Each row displays workloads in that cluster, along with recommendations for CPU and memory.

           ![Figure 4: Displaying Workloads along with Recommendations](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-each-workload.jpg) 

      2. Recommendations are shown as percentage changes by default. You can toggle **Show absolute values** to see current v/s recommended values in actual units (e.g., 128Mi → 4900Ki).

           ![Figure 5: Toggling 'Show Absolute Values'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-absolute-values.jpg)

4. You can inspect the resource recommendations for each workload within the cluster.
     1. If you wish, you can filter the workloads based on their `Kind` and `Namespace`.

           ![Figure 6a: Filtering via 'Kind'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-kind.jpg)

           ![Figure 6b: Filtering via 'Namespace'](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-namespace.jpg)

     2. You can also search for a specific workload via the search bar based on `kind`, `Namespace`, `API Version`, and `Workload`.

           ![Figure 7: Filtering via Search Bar](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/kubernetes-resource-browser/resource-recommender/resourse-recommender-search.jpg)

5. For each workload, recommendations can be of the following types:

 ### Types of Recommendation

 | Type  | Visual Indicator  |Description                              |
 |:---   |:---               |:---|
 |`↑`   | Red upward arrow   |Recommended value is higher than current |
 |`↓`   | Green upward arrow |Recommended value is lower than current  |
 |`0% -`| Gray dash (-)      |Current value equals recommended         |
 |`No Recommendation`|`No Recommendation`| No recommendation available |

 ### Supported Resources

 | Type           |Description                              |
 |:---            |:---                                     |
 |`CPU REQUESTS`  |Minimum **CPU** allocated to the workload|
 |`CPU LIMITS`    |Maximum **CPU** allocated to the workload|
 |`MEM REQUESTS`  |Minimum **Memory (RAM)** allocated to the workload|
 |`MEM LIMITS`    |Minimum **Memory (RAM)** allocated to the workload|

6. Hover the cursor over the specific resource of the particular workload to view the recommendation.
