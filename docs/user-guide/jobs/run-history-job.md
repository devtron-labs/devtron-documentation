# Run History

The run history allows you to review every execution of job pipelines. Here you can review who triggered each pipeline, when it started executing and finished, and whether it succeeded or failed. It also allows you to inspect logs for each execution.

## Accessing Run History for Specific Pipeline

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
Users need to have the **Admin role** or the **Super Admin role**.
Refer the [User permissions](../global-configurations/authorization/user-access.md#roles-available-for-jobs).
{% endhint %}

Either you have just executed the job and want to inspect the live execution, or you just want to check previous executions of a job pipeline

1. Navigate to the **Run History** tab of your job, and all the executions will appear in a reverse chronological order under the pipeline name. In case you have configured multiple job pipelines within a job, you need to select the pipeline from the **Select Pipeline** dropdown in the top-left corner.

2. Select the specific execution you want to inspect. By default, the latest execution is selected.

3. After selecting the execution, the right section of the page will display the details about that particular execution.

    |Field|Description|
    |:---|:---|
    |`Triggered`|Shows the date, time, user, and commit ID that initiated this run.|
    |`Environment`|Indicates which execution environment (e.g., devtron-ci) was used for this job.|
    |`Execution started`|Timestamp marking when the job actually began running.|
    |`Execution succeeded`|Timestamp marking when the job finished successfully.|
    |`Worker status`|Final outcome of the worker performing the job (e.g., Succeeded or Failed). On failure, the error message is also shown|

Apart from these details, you can also inspect logs, source code, security, and download artifacts (if any).

### Logs
 * In the logs tab, you can inspect logs for each pipeline stage and task along with their runtime.
 * Use the `Search log` search bar to search specific keywords or errors.
 * You can expand/collapse each pipeline stage to view specific logs related to that stage. Use the `Expand/collapse all stages` button near the search bar to expand or collapse all stages at once.
 * Select the fullscreen button in the bottom-right corner to view logs in fullscreen.

### Source

The source tab shows which commit is from the source code (configured Git repository) that is used to execute the job pipeline. It shows the following commit details:

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|`Repository name & icon` |The Git repo used with its provider logo|
|`Commit hash`|A short, clickable commit ID (e.g.â€¯443vecd) that opens the full commit details when clicked.|
|`Commit message`|Commit message used while pushing that commit|
|`Author`|Name & email of the committer.|
|`Date & time`|When that commit was authored|

### Artifacts

 The Artifacts tab shows all archives or files your job has produced such as backup binaries, reports, log bundles and let you download them for inspection or further use your job has produced.

### Security

 The Security tab provides a view of vulnerability scanning results for code, the container images used or built during the job execution. It appears when a security scan plugin (e.g., Trivy via the Code Scan plugin) is integrated into your job pipeline.

After inspecting the run history, you can also set up the [Job Overview](./overview-job.md) so that others can easily know more about the job.
