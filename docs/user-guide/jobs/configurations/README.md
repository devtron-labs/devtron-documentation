# Configurations

After you have created a Job, the next step is to configure the job. This means specifying the source code and using the Workflow Editor to create and configure the job pipeline, which includes defining tasks such as code scanning, vulnerability checks, or data migrations, and configuring the sequence in which these tasks should be executed.

In the following sections, we will explore how you can configure your Job, which includes,

1. Configuring the [Source Code](./source-code-job.md)

2. Creating and configuring the job pipeline through [Workflow Editor](./workflow-editor-job.md).

3. Defining [ConfigMaps](./configmap-secret/configmap-job.md) & [Secrets](./configmap-secret/secret-job.md), and [Environment Overrides](./environment-override-job.md) for the job.
