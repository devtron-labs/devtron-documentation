# Jobs

Devtron Jobs provide a streamlined way to execute specific tasks or sets of tasks directly on your source code within your application environment. While they operate independently of standard CI/CD pipelines, Devtron Jobs follow a pipeline-based approach to run isolated, task-specific operations.

To learn more about how Jobs work, see the full documentation below
