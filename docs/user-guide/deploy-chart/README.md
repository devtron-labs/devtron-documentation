# Chart Store

## Introduction
 
A [Helm Chart](../../reference/glossary.md#helm-chartspackages) is like a blueprint for deploying your application on Kubernetes. It contains all the necessary configuration files needed to define what and how your application should run. The **Chart Store** in Devtron offers a wide variety of helm charts from different sources for you to select and install based on your requirement. It helps you in managing and organizing charts in the same way an app store helps you manage apps. 

Navigate to the **Chart Store**.

## Fetch and Populate Charts

The **Chart Store** populates charts from two sources:

* The chart repositories added to the [Chart Repository](../global-configurations/chart-repo.md) section of the **Global Configurations** page.

* The OCI registry (only if **Use as chart repository** checkbox is enabled) added to the [Container/OCI Registry](../global-configurations/container-registries.md) section of the **Global Configurations** page.

When you add a chart repository and/or an OCI registry, the sources along with the associated charts are automatically populated in the **Chart Store**. The chart sources are displayed in the **Chart Source** drop-down box, and the charts are displayed in the **All Charts** section.

### Who Can Perform This Action?

## Search for a Chart

To quickly search for a chart, perform any of the following actions:

* Navigate to the search bar at the top-left corner of the screen. Enter the chart name you're looking for and press Enter. The chart will be displayed in the All Charts section.

* Select your preferred chart source(s) using the checkboxes in the **Chart Source** drop-down box. The charts associated with that chart source will be displayed in the All Charts section.

### Unable to Find Your Chart?

Try performing a resync by clicking the **Resync** button next to each chart source. If the chart is still not displayed, it might be deprecated. Enable the **Show deprecated charts** checkbox in the Filters section. All the deprecated charts will then be displayed in the All Charts section.
