# Chart Groups

## Introduction

A Chart Group in Devtron is a collection of [Helm charts](../../reference/glossary.md#helm-chartspackages) grouped together (e.g., what a folder is to files) to help you create, manage, and deploy them easily.

When setting up a new environment or a microservice, or when your application requires multiple Helm charts, you can simply group the required charts into a chart group. You can then view, manage, and deploy related charts together in one place instead of searching and installing each one individually.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the [Build and Deploy (CI/CD)](../../user-guide/integrations/build-and-deploy-ci-cd.md) module is installed in your Devtron instance if you are an OSS user. Enterprise user can skip this step.
