# Security Integration (Trivy)

 {% hint style="warning" %}
**Prerequisite**: **For OSS users only**: Please make sure to install **Build and Deploy (CI/CD)** integration. To install it, click [here](../integrations/build-and-deploy-ci-cd.md).
 {% endhint %}

Trivy integration enables you to scan the vulnerabilities for images, code and manifests during the time of execution.

Security is a serious concern before deploying any application. Applications can be vulnerable due to insecure code, outdated and third party libraries or misconfigured manifests, therefore, it is important to know how secure the application is, before it is deployed. To help identify these vulnerabilities, Devtron provides **Trivy** to scan source code, images and manifests for vulnerabilities.

## Using Trivy

In Devtron, **Trivy** can be used to scan vulnerabilities across various types of applications such as Devtron Apps, Helm Apps, Flux and ArgoCD Apps 

Trivy can provide 3 types of scans based on type of the application i.e., Image scan, Kubernetes Manifest Scan and Code Scan

| Type of scan | Description |
| :--- |:---|
| `Image Scan`  | Scans **Build Images** before deployment. This scan includes scanning for <br> <li>Vulnerabilities</li> <li>License Risks</li>|
| `Manifest Scan` | Scans kubernetes manifests to identify <br> <li>Misconfigurations</li> <li>Exposed Secrets</li>|
| `Code Scan` (requires **Code Scan** Plugin) | The **Code Scan** plugin of Devtron allows you to perform the code scanning using Trivy and scans for<br><li>Vulnerabilities</li> <li>License Risks</li> <li>Misconfigurations</li> <li>Exposed Secrets</li>|

Refer the below table to see which type of scans are supported across different application types in Devtron.

| Application Type | Image Scan | Code Scan<br>(Requires Plugin) | Manifest Scan |
| :--- |:--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Devtron Apps` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `Helm Apps` | ✅ | ❌ |  ✅ |
| `ArgoCD Apps` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Devtron Apps
### Where to Initiate the Scan for Devtron Apps

 For Devtron Apps, you can enable scanning by 2 ways

 | Field Name | Scans Supported |Description |
 | :--- |:---|:---|
 | `Scan for vulnerabilities` |<li>Image scan</li><li>Kubernetes Manifest scan</li> | Enables scanning for build **Images** and **Kubernetes Manifests**  before deployment.|
 | `Code Scan` (Plugin) | <li>Code Scan</li> |The **Code Scan** plugin of Devtron allows you to perform the code scanning using Trivy. |

### Enable 'Scan for vulnerabilities' option 

 {% hint style="warning" %}
 ### Who Can Perform This Action?
 Users need to have Admin permission or above (along with access to the environment and application) to enable the **Scan for vulnerabilities** option.
 {% endhint %}
 
 Devtron's CI pipeline provides a [**Scan for vulnerabilities**](../../creating-application/workflow/ci-pipeline.md#scan-for-vulnerabilities) option as shown below. Once you enable this option, it will automatically scan the image and kubernetes manifests for vulnerabilities. 
 
 Follow the below steps to enable the **Scan for vulnerabilities** option
 
 ![Figure 1: Scan for vulnerabilities](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/security-features/new/enable-image-scan.jpg)
 
 1. Navigate to **Devtron Apps** → **Select your app** → **Configurations** → **Workflow Editor**.

 2. Select the specific build pipeline for which you want to enable scanning, a **Edit deployment pipeline** modal window will appear.

 3. Enable the **Scan for vulnerabilities** toggle in the **Build stage**.

 4. Select **Update pipeline** to save the configuration.

 5. Trigger the next CI pipeline build to scan for vulnerabilities.
 
 Refer [Security Features](../../security-features/security-scans.md) to know more.

### Enable Code Scan Plugin

To enable code scan for **Devtron Apps**, you can configure code scan plugin as a pre-build task in your **Devtron App**

To configure **Code Scan** as a pre-build task, follow below steps:

 1. Navigate to **Devtron Apps** → **Select your app** → **Configurations** → **Workflow Editor**.

 2. Select the specific build pipeline for which you want to enable scanning, a **Edit deployment pipeline** modal window will appear.

 3. Navigate to **Pre-build stage**, and select **Add task** from the left side panel.

 4. Search for `Code Scan` in the **Search Plugin** Search bar and select **Code Scan** from the list of plugins. 
 
     Code Scan plugin does not require any additional configuration, if you want you can change the Task Name and Description. Refer the [Code Scan Plugin](../../plugins/code-scan.md) documentation to know more. 

 5. Select **Update Pipeline** and code scan plugin is now configured and will scan the code when the next build is triggered.

## Security Policies

Devtron allows you to define security policies based on the severity of the vulnerabilities (Critical, High, Medium, Low). Users have the flexibility to set policies that either block the deployment of container images with vulnerabilities or allow their deployment.

With this feature, users can specify their desired actions for each severity level. For example, they can choose to block any container image with Critical vulnerabilities, while allowing container images with Moderate or Low vulnerabilities to be deployed.

For in-depth instructions, refer to the [Security Policies](../../security-features/security-policies.md).
