# Security Integration (Clair)

 {% hint style="warning" %}
 ### Prerequisite
 **For OSS users**: Please ensure that [Build and Deploy (CI/CD)](../integrations/build-and-deploy-ci-cd.md) integration is installed.

 **For Enterprise Users**: **Build and Deploy (CI/CD)** integration is installed by default.
 {% endhint %}

Clair integration enables you to scan the vulnerabilities of the images during the time of image build only.

While building the container images, it is important to know how secure the application is, before it is deployed. In the application's source code, third party and outdated libraries might be used, which can add vulnerabilities to the images we deploy. Devtron provides **Clair** integration for scanning vulnerabilities of the images.
