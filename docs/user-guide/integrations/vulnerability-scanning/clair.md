# Security Integration (Clair)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Prerequisite**: **For OSS users only**: Please make sure to install **Build and Deploy (CI/CD)** integration. To install it, click [here](../integrations/build-and-deploy-ci-cd.md).
 {% endhint %}

Clair integration enables you to scan the vulnerabilities of the images during the time of image build only.

While building the container images, it is important to know how secure the application is, before it is deployed. In the source code , the third party libraries and outdated libraries might be used that can add vulnerabilities to the images we deploy. Devtron provides **Clair** integration for scanning vulnerabilities of the images.
