# Cost Visibility
## Introduction

In Devtron, Cost Visibility helps you understand your infrastructure spends. Instead of only using your cloud provider billing dashboards, you can see costs directly within Devtron, broken down by **Applications**, **Clusters**, **Environments**, **Projects**, **Infra Components**.

It tracks spend on **CPU**, **Memory**, **Storage**, **GPU**, **network**, and highlights efficiency along with potential savings. You can view costs in multiple currencies, select daily, monthly, or custom ranges, and navigate from overall spend to specific cost breakdowns.
