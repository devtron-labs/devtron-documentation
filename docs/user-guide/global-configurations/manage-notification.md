# Manage Notifications

## Introduction

Monitoring updates of your CI/CD pipelines, such as their triggers, successes, and failures, can be tricky without a notification system in place.

The **Notifications** feature in Devtron helps you solve this by sending updates about your pipelines through tools like Email, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and many more, thus ensuring you stay in the loop.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Prerequisite
OSS users should install the **Notifications** integration available in [Devtron Stack Manager](../stack-manager.md).
{% endhint %}

Go to **Global Configurations** â†’ **Notifications** to access this feature in Devtron. As shown below, there are 2 tabs available for you to manage your notification settings:
* [Configurations](#configurations)
* [Notifications](#notifications)

---

## Configurations

{% hint style="warning" %}
### Who Can Perform This Action?
Only superadmins can manage configurations.
{% endhint %}

This section allows you to perform the configurations required for your notifications to work. Make sure you finish this step before [creating a notification](#create-notifications).

![](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/configurations-tab.jpg)

Here you can add and manage the following configurations:
* [SES Configuration](#ses-configuration)
* [SMTP Configuration](#smtp-configuration)
* [Slack Configuration](#slack-configuration)
* [Webhook Configuration](#webhook-configuration)

{% hint style="info" %}
### Tip
At any point in time, you have the option to edit or delete an existing configuration or add more as per your requirements.
{% endhint %}

### SES Configuration

{% hint style="info" %}
### Prerequisites
* [Generate SMTP Credentials from AWS SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/smtp-credentials.html) - To get the user access key and secret key.
* [Verify Email Identities in AWS SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html#verify-email-addresses-procedure) - This is to verify the sender's email address (e.g., *michael@devtron.ai*) you wish to use for sending email notifications.
{% endhint %}

You can use Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) to send email notifications to the recipients.

1. Click **Add**.

2. Enter the following details in the **Configure SES** window:

    | Key | Description |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | **Configuration Name** | Give a name to your SES Configuration, e.g., `Email SES 2024` |
    | **Access Key ID** | Valid user ID from your AWS SMTP Settings page, e.g., `AKIAWEAVHF123ABCD123` |
    | **Secret Access Key** | Password from your AWS SMTP Settings page |
    | **AWS Region** | The AWS Region you used while setting up SES |
    | **Send email from** | The sender email address verified by SES for sending emails |

  ![Figure 2: Sample SES Configuration](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/ses-data.jpg)

3. (Optional) If you wish to keep your configuration as the default one for sending emails, tick the **Set as default configuration to send emails** checkbox.
