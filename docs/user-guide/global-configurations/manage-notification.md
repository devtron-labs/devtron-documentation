# Manage Notifications

## Introduction

Monitoring updates of your CI/CD pipelines, such as their triggers, successes, and failures, can be challenging without a proper notification system in place.

The **Notifications** module in Devtron helps you solve this problem by sending you timely updates about your CI/CD pipelines through various mediums such as Email, Slack, Discord, and much more - ensuring you stay informed at all times.

## Initial Prerequisites

* [Build and Deploy (CI/CD)](../integrations/build-and-deploy-ci-cd.md) integration installed in your Devtron instance.

* **Notifications** module integration installed in your Devtron instance. 

    * **For OSS users**: The **Notifications** page won't appear in Global Configurations unless you install the **Notifications** module from [Devtron Stack Manager](../integrations/README.md) (Average installation time: ~ 5–6 minutes).

    * **For Enterprise users**: This module comes installed by default. 

---

## Configurations

The **Notifications** page allows you to configure and manage notifications for your CI/CD pipeline(s). To access the **Notifications** page, navigate to **Global Configurations** → **Notifications**.

![Figure 2: Notifications Page](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/revised-imgs-21052025/notifications-screen-configurations.jpg)

The **Notifications** page has the following two tabs:

* **Configurations** - Allows you to configure the way (Email SES, Email SMTP, Slack, Webhook) through which the notifications will be delivered.

* **Notifications** - Allows you to define the recipients and the events (e.g., CI/CD success, failure, trigger) for which the notifications must be sent out.

You can configure notifications in Devtron in the following four ways: 

* [SES Configuration](#ses-configuration)

* [SMTP Configuration](#smtp-configuration)

* [Slack Configuration](#slack-configuration)

* [Webhook Configuration](#webhook-configuration)

### Email SES Configuration

{% hint style="warning" %}
    
### Who Can Perform This Action?

Only [Super-Admins](user-access.md) can create and manage SES configurations.

{% endhint %}


{% hint style="info" %}
    
### Prerequisites

AWS access key and secret key - When obtaining access key and secret access key from AWS SES, make sure to generate them from the **Security credentials** page (**Profile** → **Security credentials** → **Access keys** → **Create access key**). If you prefer to use the SMTP credentials generated from the **SMTP settings** page in AWS, please refer to [Email SMTP Configuration](#email-smtp-configuration).

Verified domain/email identities on AWS SES - To know more, visit [Creating and Verifying Identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html).

## Notifications

### Add Notifications

Once you have configured the notifications in the **Configuration** tab, you can then add, edit, and delete notifications in the **Notifications** tab. To create a new notification, follow the below instructions:

1. Navigate back to the **Notifications** tab.

    ![Figure 7: Notifications Tab](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/revised-imgs-21052025/notifications-tab.jpg)

2. Click the **Add Notification** button. The **Add Notifications** page is displayed.

    ![Figure 8: Add Notifications Page](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/revised-imgs-21052025/add-notifications-page.jpg)

3. Enter your preferred recipient in the **Send to** drop-down box. You can add one or more recipients in the **Send to** drop-down box and the recipients can be any or all of the following:

    a. A verified email address (by SES/SMTP)

    b. A Slack channel

    c. A Webhook

4. Select your preferred filter type from the following in the **Select pipelines** field:

    a. **Application** - Select **Application**, if you specifically know for which application(s) you need notifications for.

    b. **Project** - Select **Project**, if you want notifications for one or more applications within specific project(s). 

    c. **Environment** - Select **Environment**, if you want notifications for applications deployed in specific environment(s) (e.g., production).

    d. **Cluster** - Select **Cluster**, if you want notifications for applications in a specific cluster(s).

    Once you have selected your preferred filter type, a list of CI/CD pipelines are displayed as filter results. 

    * <span><img src="https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/ci1.jpg" alt="CI Icon"></span> indicates that it is a CI (Build) pipeline.

    * <span><img src="https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/cd1.jpg" alt="CD Icon"></span> indicates that it is a CD (Deployment) pipeline.

    * You can also choose to receive notifications for any CI or CD pipelines that do not exist currently but may exist in future by enabling the **All current and future pipelines matching** pipeline in the **Pipeline Name** column. 

5. Select your preferred events for which a notification must be sent out in the **Events** column. The labels are displayed when you hover over the check boxes. You can enable one or more events as per your requirements.

    a. **Trigger** - Enable this if you wish to receive notification whenever the pipeline is triggered.

    b. **Success** - Enable this if you wish to receive notification upon a successful build or deploy.

    c. **Failure** - Enable this if you wish to receive notification upon a failed build or deploy.

6. Click **Save**. The notification is now successfully added. You can now build and deploy your application to get notifications of its CI/CD events.

### Modify Notifications

You can always edit existing notifications instead of deleting them and creating new ones from scratch. For example, if you initially created notifications for **Trigger** and **Failure** events of your CI/CD pipelines, you can perform removal/addition of events anytime by modifying them.

To modify the events, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the **Notifications** tab. 

2. Select your preferred notification. 

3. Check the check box in the left side of the notification to select it. 

4. Click **Modify Events** to modify the events. Check or uncheck the events based on your requirements.

5. Click **Apply**.

![Figure 9: Modify Events](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/revised-imgs-21052025/modify-event.gif)

When creating notifications, if you previously added a recipient but now no longer want them to receive the CI/CD notifications, or if you want to add a new recipient or remove a specific communication medium (e.g., Slack), you can do so by modifying the recipients. 

To modify the recipients, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the **Notifications** tab. 

2. Select your preferred notification. 

3. Check the check box in the left side of the notification to select it. 

4. Click **Modify Recipients** to modify the recipients. Add or remove the recipients based on your requirements.

5. Click **Save Changes**.

![Figure 10: Modify Recipients](https://devtron-public-asset.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/global-configurations/manage-notification/revised-imgs-21052025/modify-receipient.gif)

### Delete Notifications

If you no longer wish to receive CI/CD notifications for an application, you can delete the corresponding notification from the **Notifications** tab. 

{% hint style="danger" %}
    
### Important Note

If you are currently receiving CI/CD notifications for a specific application, deleting its associated notification(s) in Devtron will stop the notifications for all events and recipients mentioned in those deleted notification(s).

{% endhint %}

To delete a notification, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to the **Notifications** tab. 

2. Select your preferred notification. 

3. Check the check box in the left side of the notification to select it. 

4. Click **Delete** to delete the notification.
