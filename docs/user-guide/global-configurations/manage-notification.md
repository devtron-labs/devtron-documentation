# Manage Notification

## Introduction

Monitoring updates of your CI/CD pipelines, such as their triggers, successes, and failures, can be tricky without a notification system in place.

The **Manage Notifications** feature in Devtron helps you solve this by sending updates about your pipelines through tools like Email, Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, and many more; thus ensuring you stay in the loop.
