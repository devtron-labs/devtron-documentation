# Chart Repository

## Introduction

A Chart repository is like a library where [Helm charts](../../reference/glossary.md#helm-chartspackages) are stored and shared. It provides a centralized place to store and distribute your Helm charts across environments and teams.

You can add one ore more chart repositories to Devtron. Once added, the charts from these repositories will be available in the **All Charts** section of the [Chart Store](../../user-guide/deploy-chart/README.md). This process may take a few minutes. 

By default, Devtron automatically includes a set of built-in chart repositories during installation.
