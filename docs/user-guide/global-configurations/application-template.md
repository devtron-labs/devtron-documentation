# Application Templates 

## Introduction

Application Templates in Devtron allows you to create Devtron application quickly and consistently. An application template in Devtron is created from an existing application. It captures the configuration (workflows, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Build Configurations, Source Repository, etc.) of that application, so the same setup can be reused to create new applications.

Let's assume you have already created a microservice (Devtron Application) with all the required configurations, Git Repository, Build configurations, CI/CD workflows, deployment configurations, etc. Now, instead of repeating the same setup each time when you create a new microservice, you can create an Application Template from this already configured microservice (Devtron Application). This template can then be used to quickly create new microservices (Devtron applications) with the same trusted setup.
