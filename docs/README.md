# Introduction to Devtron

Devtron is an open-source tool integration platform for Kubernetes. It is built to simplify how teams deploy, manage, secure, and observe their applications.  

Devtron is like a control plane for the entire Kubernetes app lifecycle, where CI/CD, infrastructure provisioning, cost visibility, security, and debugging all meet in one unified interface.

## Why Devtron Exists

Kubernetes is powerful but complex.  
Organizations often end up juggling 8–12 different tools just to achieve visibility, deployments, and governance. Devtron bridges these gaps by integrating all critical DevOps capabilities into a single coherent experience, without forcing teams to change their existing toolchains.

With Devtron, you can:

* **Deploy and manage** microservices across clusters with visual CI/CD pipelines.  
* **Provision infrastructure** like EKS clusters directly from the UI.  
* **Observe, debug, and troubleshoot** applications in real-time.  
* **Integrate security and cost insights** right into your release workflow.  
* **Automate repetitive DevOps workflows** using policies and templates.  
* **Leverage AI-powered recommendations** for smarter scaling, debugging, and optimization.
